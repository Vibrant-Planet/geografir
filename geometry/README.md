# Geometry

This package provides two classe for representing geospatial shapes: `Geometry` and `BoundingBox`.

- `Geometry` - is a wrapper around a `shapely` geometry with an added `crs` attribute.
- `BoundingBox` - the `minx`, `miny`, `maxx`, and `maxy` of a `Geometry` with a `crs`.

## Installation
